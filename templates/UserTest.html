          <h1>User Feedback</h1>
      <p> At first, we planed to use the dataset from the Mission China air quality monitoring program, which is a dataset that only have PM 2.5 data, and wanted to use histograms to present the data: </p>
       <img class="center-block" src="img/user.png" >
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p> We planed to show the graph for each city, and the user can choose a tab to see the result of each city. However, our users had some questions about the graph: 
<br>
1. It’s not clear to everyone that where the Chinese cities are by merely showing them the names of the cities. Though most people knew cities like Beijing or Shanghai, many people have no idea where the rest smaller cities are. Due to this feedback, we decided to present the data by plotting it on a map.
<br>
2. Many people have question that why we only use PM2.5 to represent the concept “air pollution”, since air pollution is a combination of serval different polluted particles. Thus, we decided to use another data set that can better represent the concept of air pollution, also produced an interactive feature that people can see data from different sources of air pollution.  
<br>
3. Some people questioned that how much impact PM 2.5 has. Since it could be normal that there is a certain amount PM2.5 in our environment, it’s not so clear to them how much concentration of PM2.5 will cause a hazard to health. One solution is to run a regression of the ratio population that has health diseases that caused by air pollution to the concentration of PM2.5. However, considering to better give people an intuition of heath risk, we choose to directly present the value of PM2.5 of each day and show how serious it is by indicating if it reaches the levels that cause health problems.
